# 🧠 Data Structures in Python – From Scratch


Welcome to my personal repository where I implement **classic data structures in Python** — completely from scratch — to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals. Alongside code, I’ve also included **handwritten notes** to visually explain concepts, operations, and time complexities.


## 📚 What's Inside?


This repository contains:


- ✅ Clean implementations of basic and advanced data structures
- ✍️ Hand-drawn notes for theory, visualizations, and operations
- 🧪 Minimal test cases for validating functionality
